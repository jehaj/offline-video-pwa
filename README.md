# offline-video-pwa

If run with WebStorm, then it serves all files in the directory. I have created another directory named `vid`, 
where the videos are stored. The two videos are named `around.webm` and `close.webm`.

Another way to serve the files is using python with
```
python -m http.server
```
standing in the root of this repository. You would have to change the urls in `index.html` though.

Good luck!
