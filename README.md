# offline-video-pwa

If run with WebStorm, then it serves all files in the directory. You might have to change the URLs in index.html.
I have created another directory named `vid`, where the videos are stored. The two videos are named `around.webm` 
and `close.webm`.

Another way to serve the files is using python with
```
python -m http.server
```
standing in the root of this repository.

Good luck!

The project is done now. It followed the guide/example at [mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).
